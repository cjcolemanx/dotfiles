# Set up environment variables

Some stuff I'm not gonna track anymore

```
WALLPAPER="/path/to/wallpaper.jpg"
BSPWM_SCRIPTS="/path/to/bin/bspwm" # Not really used, I don't thinkg (safety first)
BAT_CONFIG_PATH="~/.config/bat/bat.conf"
I3BLOCKS_SCCRIPT_DIR="~/.config/i3blocks/scripts"
NNN_FIFO="/tmp/nnn.fifo" # Probably
```

I also like to add folder aliases here, especially for my other hard drives -
like `export MUSIC="/mnt/Media/music"`
